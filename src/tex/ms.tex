\begin{abstract}
    TIC 277 is currently the star with the highest latitude flare located to date. In 2020, TESS observed this rapidly rotating M7 dwarf produce a flare at 81 deg latitude. This is in stark contrast to solar flares that occur much closer to the equator, typically below 30 deg. Does a star require a special corona to produce polar flares?

    We obtained 36 ks ob XMM-Newton observations, and determined that the X-ray luminosity $L_X$ is slightly lower but not far below the $L_X$ of other stars with similar spectral types a rotation rates. We constructed flare frequency distributions using the three TESS Sectors, with a power law slope of $XXXX\pm XXXX$, and flare rate above $\log_{10}E=31.5\,$erg of XXXX, again typical of similar stars. Our results suggest that the star's magnetic activity is typical for its rotation rate and mass. However, the rotation period of 4.56 hours is on the short end, which could indicate that polar flares on these stars are a feature of youth.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The smallest stars are crawling with rocky planets. The disk mass around the smallest stars decreases such that giant planets are no longer efficiently formed, leaving room for smaller objects in the orbit~(XXXX). Terrestrial planets in the habitable zones of these stars are a factor of XXXX more likely than around higher mass stars~\citep{hardegree-ullman2019kepler}. However, to be habitable in an Earth-like sense, merely the possibility of surface water in its liquid form does not suffice. Space weather of the host, that is, the high energy radiation and particles that force the planet's atmosphere, is another important factor. If the energetic particle flux is too high, the atmosphere may blow off. If not energetic enough, life may not emerge in the first place.

At the lowest masses, a star's evolution unfolds much slower than for a Sun. While the Sun's magnetic activity, and with it the flares, winds, coronal mass ejections and energetic particle eruption that make up space weather, decline rapidly over a few hundred megayears, a fully convective M dwarf stays highly active for gigayears. Add that the zone where liquid water can reside is much closer to these faint stars, and the result is a planet that may be exposed to violent space weather conditions for a good fraction of the age of the universe. 

Space weather originates from the stellar corona. The transition from star to brown dwarf is characterized by increasing rotation speed and decreasing coronal emission. The simultaneous surge of radio emission indicates a transition from stellar corona to planet-like magnetosphere at the bottom of the main sequence. Yet, brown dwarfs are regularly detected with energetic flares regardless of their low X-ray luminosity. How these flares are produced in the apparent absence of a solar-type corona is unclear. An intermittent corona is conceivable, similarly XYZ. Perhaps, the rapid rotation of these low-mass objects plays a role, as it governs the dynamo process within, and consequently influences the complex process of flux emergence~\citep{weber2023understanding}.   

\citet{ilin2021giant} searched fully convective dwarfs observed in TESS, and found four flares on four rapidly rotating ($P<10\,$h) M5-M7 dwarfs. These flares' durations spanned multiple rotation periods of each star, so that the flares were observed to rotate in and out view. The shape of this modulation together with known inclination (combining $P$ and $v \sin i$ from high resolution spectroscopy) allowed them to determine the latitudes of these flares. Surprisingly, these flares were found closer to the pole than to the equator, in contrast to the Sun, where flares are usually found below 30 deg latitude. Their results indicate a preference for flares at high latitudes in these star, as a chance finding was unlikely ($0.1\%$). If flares and associated particle eruptions have a latitude preference, the space weather of a planet in an aligned orbit would be less severe than previously thought. %Are high flaring latitudes  an effect of the dynamo at high rotation speeds? Or is there something special about these stars' coronae that allowed them to produce flares at these latitudes? 

%Planets around late M dwarfs exists, see TRAPPIST-1 or LHS 3154~\citep{stefansson2023extreme}

TIC 277539431, TIC 277 for short, is one out of four stars with a high-latitude flare in its TESS observations~\citep{ilin2021giant}. In fact, it showed the highest latitude flare known to date at $81\pm1\,$deg. TIC 277 is an M7 dwarf with a rotation period of 4.56 hours. Its age is unknown. \citet{schneider2018hazmat} classify it as a field star, but its FUV and NUV fluxes are on the high end for field stars and would be compatible with the NUV/FUV emission from younger open cluster members, as well. 
Is its high flaring latitude an effect of the dynamo at high rotation speeds? Or is there something special about this star's corona that led it to produce are flare at these latitudes? 

In this work, we follow TIC 277 with XMM-Newton for 36 ks and use optical monitoring from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite~(TESS,~\citealt{ricker2015transiting}) to measure its coronal properties, and investigate if producing a high-latitude flare requires an unusual corona, or if it is rather typical of stars of this spectral type and rotation.

\section{Observations}

\subsection{XMM-Newton}
XMM-Newton observed TIC 277 for 36 ks, i.e. two full rotation periods of the star, on August 5, 2022 (Proposal 090120; PI: E. Ilin). We used the EPIC instruments aboard XMM-Newton, i.e., MOS1/2 and PN, that cover the soft X-ray band between 0.2-12 keV. 

\subsubsection{Time series with EPIC and OM}

 We extracted the events time series from EPIC using XMM SAS version 20 using the \texttt{evselect} task. We selected a circular source region with 20 arcsec radius on all detectors, and a circular source-free background region 120 and 90 arcsec in MOS and PN, respectively. We used the \texttt{epiclccorr} task in XMM SAS to correct for energy and time dependent loss of events\footnote{\url{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/sas/help/epiclccorr/node3.html}, accessed on July 3, 2023}, and extract a soft X-ray time series with a time binning of 200 s.

Simultaneously, we used the optical monitor (OM) aboard XMM-Newton, to monitor TIC 277 in its white light filter at $10$\,s cadence. The OM white light filter is centered on $XXXX\AA$, with an equivalent width of $XXXX\AA$. We used the \texttt{omfchain} in XMM SAS to extract the 8 individual light curves.

Fig.~\ref{fig:lightcurves} shows the time series using the combined PN and MOS time series together with the OM light curve.

        }
        \label{fig:lightcurves}
    \end{centering}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{EPIC Spectra}
From the EPIC observations, we extracted spectra using \texttt{evselect,epatplot,backscale,rmfgen,arfgen}, and \texttt{grppha}. 

\subsection{TESS}

Since 2018, TESS has been supplying publicly available red-optical high-precision time series photometry in an ongoing all-sky survey. Each uninterrupted observing Sector provides an approximately 27 day long light curve in a broad $XXXX$-$XXXX\AA$ band pass. 

We used 5 Sectors of optical monitoring of TIC 277 in 2-minute cadence by TESS. Sector 12 was observed in May 2019, Sectors 37 and 39 in April and June 2021, and Sectors 64 and 65 in April and May 2023. 

We used AltaiPony~\citep{ilin2021altaipony} to de-trend the light curves using the custom de-trending function \texttt{custom\_detrending}\footnote{see also the documentation online at \url{https://altaipony.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/detrend.html}, accessed on July 3, 2023}, detailed in~\citet{ilin2022searching}. The procedure includes 3rd order spline fitting of coarse trends, followed by iterative sine fitting to remove rotational modulation, and the two Savitzky-Golay filters with a 6h and 3h window, respectively to remove aperiodic short term trends, while masking outliers above $>2.5\sigma$, as well as the six-fold of consecutive orginally masked data points following the original mask, and finally, additional 3 adjacent data point before and after the so expanded mask. 

In the de-trended light curves, we searched for flare candidates as at least 3 consecutive $>3\sigma$ outliers above the noise level in the masked light curve, filling in the noise level inside the masked areas with the mean of the noise levels adjecent to the mask. To the series of outliers, we kept adding data points to the flare candidate until a data point falls below $XXXX\sigma$. 

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}


\subsection{Spectral fitting}
We use XSPEC version 12.12.1~\citep{arnaud1996xspec} to fit a two-temperature additive APEC~\citep{smith2001collisional,foster2012updated} model to the joint PN and MOS spectra, using solar abundances from~\citet{grevesse1998standard}, but adjusting to an Fe/0=.6 ratio, which is more typical of M dwarfs~\citep{wood2018chandra}. We analyzed both the full data set, and the quiescent and flaring parts separately. In the full data set, we used the \texttt{bayes} method in XSPEC to assign constant priors within the model's hard limits, and sample the uncertainties using the Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) method using \texttt{chain} for a total of 30000 steps, discarding the first 5000 as the burn-in phase. From the same fit, but using PN data only, we derived the flux and X-ray luminosity in the 0.2-12 keV band. For the quiescent and flaring portions of the observations, we chose the same procedure, but chose the Gaussian prior distributions for the two coronal temperatures using the full data set as ground truth, and assigning the largest of the upper and lower uncertainties as standard deviation.

\subsection{Flares}

\subsubsection{XMM-Newton flare}

We fitted the soft X-ray light curve using constant flux with a flare, applying the~\citet{davenport2014kepler} optical flare model that captures the fast rise and exponential decay of the flare seen with XMM-Newton. From the fit, we extracted the baseline flux against which we measured the equivalent duration $ED$ of the flare

ED EQUATION

We then converted ED to flare energy in the 0.2-12 keV band by multiplying with $L_X$. 

Lacking calibration for the white light filter in OM, we used the effective width of the passband to extract the conversion factor for a 10kK flare to obtain the corrected $ED$, which we could multiply with $L_{\rm bol}$ to arrive at the bolometric flare energy. $L_{\rm bol}$ was derived using G and J magnitudes, converting J to V mag, then using the bolometric correction from
\subsubsection{TESS flares}

Similar to the OM flare, we used the TESS response curve to obtain the conversion factor in the redder optical filter of TESS, and convert to bolometric flare energy.

\subsection{Coronal temperature and luminosity}

% From the proposal: $F_X=2.7^{-13}$ erg/s/cm$^2$, $L_X=6\cdot10^27$ erg/s (update with new eROSITA data) -- 1 oom above the measured XMM values.

From the XMM-Newton EPIC spectra, we could measure the coronal properties of TIC in both its quiescent, and flaring states~(Table~\ref{tab:specfit}). Using the combined quiescent and flaring data, we found a two-temperature VAPEC model to fit better than a one-temperature solution and no worse than a three-temperature solution. The resulting fit~(Fig.~\ref{fig:spec_joint_all}) consists of a cooler and a hotter component of about $3.1\,$MK and $13.4\,$MK, respectively. The emission measure (norm) weighted mean temperature was $8\,$MK. With these temperatures as ground truth, we also fitted two-temperature VAPEC models to the flaring and quiescent portions of the observations separately. The coronal temperatures did not update significantly using either subset, although the quiescent spectrum appeared slightly cooler overall. However, the emission measure weighted mean temperature was about $1.5\,$MK cooler in the quiescent spectrum, and $\sim3.3\,$MK hotter in the flaring spectrum. This suggests that the flaring corona emits the hotter component, while the cooler component corresponds to the quiescent corona. In this interpretation, the presence of a hot component in the quiescent spectrum indicates suggests that TIC 277 is flaring below the detection threshold, consistent with an extrapolation of the flare frequency distribution to lower temperatures~(see the following Section, and Fig.~\ref{fig:ffd}).

From the PN spectra, we measured a soft X-ray flux of $F_X=XXXX$, and a luminosity $L_X=XXXX$ in the $0.2-2\,$keV band. In the broader $0.2-10\,$keV band, we measured XXXX and XXXX.

\subsection{Flares}

X-ray energy of $8.4\pm0.7\cdot10^{30}\,$erg
OM energy of XXXX

Ratio of OM and EPIC flare compared to \citet{guarcello2019simultaneous} simultaneous K2 and XMM flares

In TESS, we found 8 flares

FFD power law fit converged after 16000 steps on $\alpha = 1.77_{-0.23}^{+0.29}$.

The OM flare energy fits the extension of TESS' flare frequency distributions to lower energies within uncertainties on the power law fit. Roughly one flare per day of the order of the observed one or above can therefore be expected in future X-ray observations of TIC 277.



\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
% \citep{pass2022constraints} on rotational evol of late Ms

Is the magnetic activity of the star with the highest known flare latitude known to date is any way unusual? The star is rotating rapidly, even for the typically fast rotating late M dwarfs~\citep{medina2022galactic}. This could lead to an unusual manifestation of the stellar dynamo that produces high latitude flares that other dynamo states cannot generate. With TESS and XMM-Newton, we can now evaluate if this suspected exceptionality is reflected in the star's magnetic activity and coronal properties. We compare its flaring activity, coronal luminosity and temperatures to stars of similar spectral type and rotation rates

\subsection{Flaring activity}
\label{sec:discussion:flares}

$\log_10(R_{31.5}$, that is, the rate of flares per day with energies above $\log E_{flare}=10^{31.5}\,$erg, is ca. $-1.XXXX$, consistent with other saturated late M dwarfs~\citep{medina2022galactic}.

Compared to the X-ray luminosities of M7 dwarfs among the late M dwarfs observed by eROSITA in \citet{stelzer2022first}, TIC 277 appears mildly underluminous. This could be an effect of its fast rotation, and consequent supersaturation as in \citet{magaudda2022first}, but we lack the rotation periods to confirm this.

Using eROSITA data, \citet{magaudda2022first} cover both fully convective and rapidly rotating M dwarfs, and find a downward trend with decreasing rotation period, pointing toward a supersaturation of the corona at fast rotation speeds, as has been conjectured before~\citep{jeffries2011investigating,ramsay2020tess}. \citet{jeffries2011investigating} suggest that the cause for supersaturation is centrifugal stripping of the corona, but \citet{reiners2022magnetism} show that if magnetic field increases, X-ray increases likewise with no sign of a break. They conclude that the trend is rather due to the underlying dynamo.
